> XMB displays icons horizontally which can be selected with the handheld's directional buttons in place of a cursor. The icons are symbolic representations of the commands they correspond to, such as a film cell to depict movies or Universal Media Discs and a camera to categorise photographs. On selecting a horizontal icon, several options appear vertically which can also be selected using the directional buttons. The UI was so successful it was awarded the Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award for 'Outstanding Innovation and Achievement in Advanced Media Technology for the Best Use of Personal Media Display and Presentation Technology' in 2006.
