> The period was marked by the founding (and, in many cases, spectacular failure) of a group of new Internet [11] -based companies commonly referred to as dot-coms [12] .

And in this case, much of the capital invested was lost, but also much of it was invested in a very high throughput [124] backbone for the Internet, and lots of software that works, and databases and server structure. All that stuff has allowed what we have today, which has changed all our lives...that's what all this speculative mania built'.
