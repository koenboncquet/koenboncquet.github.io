> The original designers of the Mac user interface understood this. When the Mac still had a Spatial Finder, file 'paths' were never  seen by a user: not in open/save dialog boxes, not in search results windows, not anywhere. Mac users never had to see file paths, and were never expected to enter or know them. Rare was the Mac user who even knew which character was used as the file path separator in Mac OS. But even the most novice DOS (or, later, Windows) user knew about their friend the backslash.
