> Back in 1984, explanations of the original Mac interface to users who had never seen a GUI before inevitably included an explanation of icons that went something like this: "This icon represents your file on disk." But to the surprise of many, users very quickly discarded any semblance of indirection. This icon *is* my file. My file is this icon. One is not a "representation of" or an "interface to" the other. Such relationships were foreign to most people, and constituted unnecessary mental baggage when there was a much more simple and direct connection to what they knew of reality.

All software or hardware systems that incorporate this indirection will create confusion. Android for example still has this (apps vs shortcuts). The app icon should be the only entry point for the app. The android shortcuts can create confusing situations. For example, there can be two facebook icons on your homescreen, both shortcuts, and one icon in your app drawer.

So generally speaking, the problem occurs when users have to create a mental model that is more complex or less familiar. 

I think this same argumentation can be used in touch screen vs mouse computing. When you use your mouse to move the on-screen cursor, you have to do a mental mapping to understand that moving the object on your desk results in the cursor moving on your screen. For most of us this is super obvious, but I have actually seen people having trouble performing this mental mapping. Look at it this way: a toddler is able to interact with an tablet from the moment his motor skills will allow him. I'm not sure the same counts for mouse interaction; directly touching the thing you want is just more intuitive.
