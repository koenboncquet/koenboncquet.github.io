> We have a problem today of two Europes: a digital Europe and an analogue Europe. Of digital mind-sets and analogue mind-sets. These are two Europes that rarely talk to each other. Two Europes that hold back all of Europe because they are not in sync. There is a Europe that is full of energy and digital ideas.  We have a growing start-up scene with thousands of people who are the smartest in the world at what they do. From Skype to Spotify to SAP, from Rovio to Booking.com  to Campus Party. We have a young generation that uses their digital devices and apps and new ways of building communities and businesses. This Europe is optimistic. This is the Europe where half of new jobs come from – the ICT-enabled jobs. This Europe is mobile and flexible. This Europe hates barriers and looks for new opportunities. This is the Europe that likes innovation – and is happy to use Uber and Air BnB.
