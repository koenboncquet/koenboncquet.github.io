> In messaging we have seen two levels of innovation in experience. WhatsApp delivers 'SMS 2.0' - it does the things that telco technologies like IMS were supposed to add close to a decade ago, but not much more, so far. On the other, we have things like Line, Wechat, Kik and Snapchat that actually change what messaging is, even before you look at the platform elements of their offerings. I suspect (but no more) that it is harder fundamentally to change what voice is than to create alternatives to a snippet of text, and so the basic voice experience might change less - the innovation, like WhatsApp, may be more about the handling and routing and setup.
