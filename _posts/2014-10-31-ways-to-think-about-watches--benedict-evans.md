> mobile phone is not a landline that doesn’t have a wire - it changes large parts of how you can live your life, so much so that it was not obvious in 1995 what would change. So too a smart watch. Yes, it tells the time, but what else?

> Today, smartwatches are more like vitamins (nice to have) than painkillers (must have) so 90% of the people would not want one in 2015, but the same 90% will wonder how they'd live without one in 2025. All computers have evolved this way to make our lives more informed, more convenient, and more productive. The IBM System 360 mainframe was nice to have in 1965 but became indispensible to large corporations by 1975. Same goes for PCs (1984 vs 1994), Internet (1995 vs 2005), modern smartphones (2007 vs 2017), etc.
