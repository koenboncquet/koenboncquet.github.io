> Limiting the number of menu tabs or the number of items in a dropdown list to the George Miller’s magic number 7 [1]  is a false constraint. Miller’s original theory argues that people can keep no more than 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their short-term memory. On a webpage, however, the information is visually present, people don’t have to memorize anything and therefore can easily manage broader choices.
