> Part of the reason for Google to change what 'Android' means is control, but a deeper one is to change the smartphone interaction model. It's always been obvious that apps were a structural problem for Google, since their content is hidden from search and more importantly unlinkable from search results, paid or not.

> What we can see happening now are shifts in the layers of aggregation and discovery. We've gone from everything being bundled within the web browser, and then accessed through Google (itself a bundle) to app icons unbundling specific content from the web. At the same time apps bundle all the content from one site and make it impossible to link directly to a specific page. Hence we now have both deep linking, which lets you get into the silo, and rich actionable notifications unbundling pieces of content out of the silo. And we also have cards  floating around (delivered in many different ways) as another unbundling metaphor.

> Across all of this, and far more important, we are now well on our way to having some 3.5bn to 4bn people on earth with a smartphone - there are probably 2bn today, and close to 4bn people with a mobile phone (the number of duplicate SIMs makes the number of active connection closer to 6bn). This compares to around 1.6bn PCs, of which roughly half are consumer and half corporate. So there will be something like 5 times more smartphones than consumer PCs, and those devices are always with you and, with all their apps and sensors, are much more sophisticated than PCs ever were, seen as internet devices.
