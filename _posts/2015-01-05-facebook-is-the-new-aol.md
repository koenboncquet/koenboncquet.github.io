> But while Sony's failure to understand software allowed Apple and then Samsung to overtake its core businesses, it's Apple's failure to understand services that remains its critical weakness. The tight combination of hardware and software has become religion at Google and Microsoft; new products from both companies are either tightly controlled (like Android Wear) or simply built in-house (like Lumia phones). Apple still hasn't figured out how to expand its platforms onto the wider internet in a way that makes them feel as safe and broadly available as Google; the best-known thing iCloud's ever done is leak nude photos. Solving this problem is where Apple needs to spend the most of its energy.
