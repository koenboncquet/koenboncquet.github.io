> In philosophy and rhetoric, the principle of charity  requires interpreting a speaker's statements to be rational and, in the case of any argument, considering its best, strongest possible interpretation. 1  In its narrowest sense, the goal of this methodological principle is to avoid attributing irrationality, logical fallacies  or falsehoods to the others' statements, when a coherent, rational interpretation of the statements is available.
