> In the VR community, “presence” is a term of art. It’s the idea that once VR reaches a certain quality level your brain is actually tricked  —  at the lowest, most primal level  —  into believing that what you see in front of you is reality. Studies show that even if you rationally believe you’re not truly standing at the edge of a steep cliff, and even if you try with all your might to jump, your legs will buckle. Your low-level lizard brain won’t let you do it. With presence, your brain goes from feeling like you have a headset on to feeling like you’re immersed in a different world.

> This has implications for the kinds of software that will succeed in VR. For example, a popular video game like Call of Duty ported to VR would be frightening and disorienting for most people. What will likely succeed instead are relatively simple experiences. Some examples: go back in time and walk around ancient Rome; overcome your fear of heights by climbing skyscrapers; execute precision moves as you train to safely land planes; return to places you “3D photographed” on your last vacation; have a picnic on a sunny afternoon with a long-lost friend; build trust with virtual work colleagues in a way that today you can only do in person.
