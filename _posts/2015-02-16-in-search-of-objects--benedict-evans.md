> This requires some new mental models, as we will see when Apple reveals the price of the rose-gold version, which will probably be somewhere north of $5000 simply as a function of the cost of the gold. A portion of the tech community will be both loudly scandalised and also secretly comforted: its view of Apple as a maker of overpriced gimmicks sold 'just' on fashion instead of technology will be confirmed. But this has always been the direction of travel, right back to mice, which no serious computer user believed in: the future of technology has always looked like a pretty toy to people comfortable with the past.

> There's a sense that by getting an app you have somehow captured what's inside it - pinned it to your home screen like a collector's butterfly. It's no longer an intangible web page, floating somewhere out there, that you got to through Google and that might not be there anymore, but rather you've saved it for yourself. Maybe this is one reason why people hoard apps - you might use them, you think, and you don't want to have to go back and remember them or find them again. An app is tangible  - it's a thing that you have and keep and can't lose or forget.
