One reason it was possible was a trick borrowed from his favorite area of the brain. Part of the Atari-playing software’s learning process involved replaying its past experiences over and over to try and extract the most accurate hints on what it should do in the future. “That’s something that we know the brain does,” says Hassabis. “When you go to sleep your hippocampus replays the memory of the day back to your cortex.” <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">rtificial intelligence researchers have been tinkering with reinforcement learning for decades.
