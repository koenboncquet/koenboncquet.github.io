        <title>Easy money in gaming</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The easy money in gaming isn’t actually to bankroll a $200 million console blockbuster, half of which is probably marketing. Rather, it’s to put a carefully tuned slot machine under the noses of as many people as possible, like say, a free-to-play smartphone game.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anybody who has played a game by King (e.g. Candy crush saga) will recognize this. Although you’ll find such games under the puzzle category, they really aren’t puzzle games at all.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A sense of indirection</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Back in 1984, explanations of the original Mac interface to users who had never seen a GUI before inevitably included an explanation of icons that went something like this: “This icon represents your file on disk.” But to the surprise of many, users very quickly discarded any semblance of indirection. This icon &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; my file. My file is this icon. One is not a “representation of” or an “interface to” the other. Such relationships were foreign to most people, and constituted unnecessary mental baggage when there was a much more simple and direct connection to what they knew of reality.
- &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/apple/2003/04/finder/3/&quot;&gt;John Siracusa in About the finder (2003)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All software or hardware systems that incorporate this indirection will create confusion. Android for example still has this (apps vs shortcuts). The app icon should be the only entry point for the app. The android shortcuts can create confusing situations. For example, there can be two facebook icons on your homescreen, both shortcuts, and one icon in your app drawer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So generally speaking, the problem occurs when users have to create a mental model that is more complex or less familiar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this same argumentation can be used in touch screen vs mouse computing. When you use your mouse to move the on-screen cursor, you have to do a mental mapping to understand that moving the object on your desk results in the cursor moving on your screen. For most of us this is super obvious, but I have actually seen people having trouble performing this mental mapping. Look at it this way: a toddler is able to interact with an tablet from the moment his motor skills will allow him. I’m not sure the same counts for mouse interaction; directly touching the thing you want is just more intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Power to consumers</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Power has shifted from companies to consumers, and expectations have never been higher. Companies can’t get away with having crummy products, at least not for long. For example, bad product reviews trump clever marketing. Today, great products win.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note to this: a lot of people still buy cheap products that have a reasonable price-quality ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Human interface objects</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Human interface objects that can be seen are quite familiar in graphic user interfaces. Objects that are perceived by another sense such as hearing or touch are less familiar or are not necessarily recognized by us as being objects. Ring tones are auditory objects, for example, but we tend to just think of them as ring tones, without assigning any higher-level category to them.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting that something visual is more likely to be perceived as an object. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Owned vs open</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My prediction is that, unless the leadership vacuum is filled, the Web is going to retreat back to its origins as a network of hyperlinked documents. The Web will be just another app that you use when you want to find some information, like Wikipedia, but it will no longer be your primary window. The Web will no longer be the place for social networks, games, forums, photo sharing, music players, video players, word processors, calendaring, or anything interactive. Newspapers and blogs will be replaced by Facebook and Twitter and you will access them only through native apps. HTTP will live on as the data backbone used by native applications, but it will no longer serve those applications through HTML. Freedom of information may be restricted to whatever our information overlords see fit to feature on their App Market Stores.

        <title>A mobile centric world</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When users greatly favor a new user experience over an old one (in this case the mobile application environment versus a browser based desktop environment), the implication is clear – we are in the middle of a critical platform transition. Platform transitions are rare, yet highly consequential. The first consumer-based transition was DOS to Windows in the late 1980s. Many fortunes were won and lost based on how well companies like Borland and Lotus executed this transition. Then came client-server, which also launched new winners at the expense of older incumbents. The next obvious transition was the rise of the browser in 1996, which transformed not only the software application market but also the print and media world. The browser-based Internet launched many new companies, several of which have achieved market capitalizations in the billions. Most interestingly, new company wealth (pure play Internet companies) far exceeds “transitioned wealth” (incumbent companies transitioning their model successfully to the new platform). TripAdvisor and Yelp rule the day, not Frommers and Zagat. Likewise Priceline and Expedia rule travel, not some travel company that existed pre-Internet. Google, Yahoo, Ebay, Facebook, and Twitter rule the Internet, not Microsoft.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The core concept of “search” is in transition. Search plays a completely different role on the desktop than it does on the smartphone. On the browser, nearly every activity starts with search. On the smartphone, apps replace search as a starting point.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly my thoughts. Browsers are search-centric, mobile devices are app-centric. The question is if the mobile appstores should incorporate more search like features.&lt;/p&gt;
