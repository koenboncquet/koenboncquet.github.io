Evolution, so far, may possibly have blocked us from being able to think in some directions; there could be unthinkable thoughts.</p>

  <p>I would argue that Yahoo lost its way early. Yahoo was an amazing, awesome resource when it first appeared, as a directory to cool websites. Arguably, the  directory to cool websites. It was hard to find the good stuff on the early web, and Yahoo created a map. Their whole reason for being was to serve as a starting point that sent you elsewhere. Then came portals. The portal strategy was the opposite of the directory strategy — it was about keeping people on Yahoo’s site, instead of sending them elsewhere. It was lucrative for a while, but ran its course. And it turned out that the web quickly became too large, far too large, for a human-curated directory to map more than a fraction of it. The only way to index the web was algorithmically, as a search engine. And one search engine stood head and shoulders above all others: Google. Yahoo reportedly had an opportunity to buy Google in 2002 for $5 billion . Yahoo, under the leadership of CEO Terry Semel, declined. And that was the end of Yahoo.</p>

  <p>I can relate to this skepticism since I too was once on that side of the fence. It is tempting to presume that mobile devices and basic Internet services are plug-and-play; that they have perfectly optimized their user experiences and can successfully onboard anyone, any time, any day. But the reality is we live in a world where 4.3 billion people have never experienced the Internet. These are people who mostly can’t tell what the X at the top-right of the screen does, or what “sign up” means, or what a username and password are, or that cancel buttons are red or gray, or how a QWERTY keyboard works, or how to sign up for mobile data, or why should one even do it in the first place. All this represents a highly complex, multifaceted problem and the payoff of ultimately solving it will fundamentally change us as a species.</p>

  <p>Product management is a weird discipline full of oddballs and rejects that never quite fit in anywhere else. For my part, I loved the technical challenges of engineering but despised the coding. I liked solving problems, but I hated having other people tell me what to do. I wanted to be a part of the strategic decisions, I wanted to own  the product. Marketing appealed to my creativity, but I knew I’d dislike being too far away from the technology. Engineers respected me, but knew my heart was elsewhere and generally thought I was too ‘marketing-ish.’ People like me naturally gravitate to product management.</p>

  <p>rtificial intelligence researchers have been tinkering with reinforcement learning for decades. But until DeepMind’s Atari demo, no one had built a system capable of learning anything nearly as complex as how to play a computer game, says Hassabis. One reason it was possible was a trick borrowed from his favorite area of the brain. Part of the Atari-playing software’s learning process involved replaying its past experiences over and over to try and extract the most accurate hints on what it should do in the future. “That’s something that we know the brain does,” says Hassabis. “When you go to sleep your hippocampus replays the memory of the day back to your cortex.”</p>

  <p>Part of the reason for Google to change what ‘Android’ means is control, but a deeper one is to change the smartphone interaction model. It’s always been obvious that apps were a structural problem for Google, since their content is hidden from search and more importantly unlinkable from search results, paid or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What we can see happening now are shifts in the layers of aggregation and discovery. We’ve gone from everything being bundled within the web browser, and then accessed through Google (itself a bundle) to app icons unbundling specific content from the web. At the same time apps bundle all the content from one site and make it impossible to link directly to a specific page. Hence we now have both deep linking, which lets you get into the silo, and rich actionable notifications unbundling pieces of content out of the silo. And we also have cards  floating around (delivered in many different ways) as another unbundling metaphor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><!-- --> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Across all of this, and far more important, we are now well on our way to having some 3.5bn to 4bn people on earth with a smartphone - there are probably 2bn today, and close to 4bn people with a mobile phone (the number of duplicate SIMs makes the number of active connection closer to 6bn). This compares to around 1.6bn PCs, of which roughly half are consumer and half corporate. So there will be something like 5 times more smartphones than consumer PCs, and those devices are always with you and, with all their apps and sensors, are much more sophisticated than PCs ever were, seen as internet devices. </p>
