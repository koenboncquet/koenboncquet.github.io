  <p>The brilliant work that Xerox Parc did with windows that could overlap and mice that could point and click was groundbreaking. It really helped people use computers. And part of the way it helped is that it had object relationships. Some people didn’t understand. I’m not even sure anybody understood why that was valuable. 
The reason why the computer desktop works with overlapping windows representing documents is not because it looks like your physical desk, but because when you work on your physical desk, the same things happen. You put the important things on top. […] It’s an interaction congruity - a functional congruity. It happens to have a visual congruity as well, but that’s not the essential part.

  <p>We have a problem today of two Europes: a digital Europe and an analogue Europe. Of digital mind-sets and analogue mind-sets. These are two Europes that rarely talk to each other. Two Europes that hold back all of Europe because they are not in sync. There is a Europe that is full of energy and digital ideas. We have a growing start-up scene with thousands of people who are the smartest in the world at what they do. From Skype to Spotify to SAP, from Rovio to Booking.com to Campus Party. We have a young generation that uses their digital devices and apps and new ways of building communities and businesses. This Europe is optimistic. This is the Europe where half of new jobs come from the ICT-enabled jobs. This Europe is mobile and flexible. This Europe hates barriers and looks for new opportunities. This is the Europe that likes innovation – and is happy to use Uber and Air BnB.

<p>If we’re not open to disruptive business models and if we keep charging people for surfing/calling from another European country, it will be hard to get rid of the analogue Europe.

          <blockquote>
  <p>Back in 1984, explanations of the original Mac interface to users who had never seen a GUI before inevitably included an explanation of icons that went something like this: “This icon represents your file on disk.” But to the surprise of many, users very quickly discarded any semblance of indirection. This icon <em>is</em> my file. My file is this icon. One is not a “representation of” or an “interface to” the other. Such relationships were foreign to most people, and constituted unnecessary mental baggage when there was a much more simple and direct connection to what they knew of reality.
- <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2003/04/finder/3/">John Siracusa in About the finder (2003)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All software or hardware systems that incorporate this indirection will create confusion. Android for example still has this (apps vs shortcuts). The app icon should be the only entry point for the app. The android shortcuts can create confusing situations. For example, there can be two facebook icons on your homescreen, both shortcuts, and one icon in your app drawer.</p>

<p>So generally speaking, the problem occurs when users have to create a mental model that is more complex or less familiar. </p>

<p>I think this same argumentation can be used in touch screen vs mouse computing. When you use your mouse to move the on-screen cursor, you have to do a mental mapping to understand that moving the object on your desk results in the cursor moving on your screen. For most of us this is super obvious, but I have actually seen people having trouble performing this mental mapping. Look at it this way: a toddler is able to interact with an tablet from the moment his motor skills will allow him. I’m not sure the same counts for mouse interaction; directly touching the thing you want is just more intuitive.</p>

  <p>Human interface objects that can be seen are quite familiar in graphic user interfaces.

  <p>My prediction is that, unless the leadership vacuum is filled, the Web is going to retreat back to its origins as a network of hyperlinked documents. The Web will be just another app that you use when you want to find some information, like Wikipedia, but it will no longer be your primary window. The Web will no longer be the place for social networks, games, forums, photo sharing, music players, video players, word processors, calendaring, or anything interactive. Newspapers and blogs will be replaced by Facebook and Twitter and you will access them only through native apps. HTTP will live on as the data backbone used by native applications, but it will no longer serve those applications through HTML. Freedom of information may be restricted to whatever our information overlords see fit to feature on their App Market Stores.

          <blockquote>
  <p>When users greatly favor a new user experience over an old one (in this case the mobile application environment versus a browser based desktop environment), the implication is clear – we are in the middle of a critical platform transition. Platform transitions are rare, yet highly consequential. The first consumer-based transition was DOS to Windows in the late 1980s. Many fortunes were won and lost based on how well companies like Borland and Lotus executed this transition. Then came client-server, which also launched new winners at the expense of older incumbents. The next obvious transition was the rise of the browser in 1996, which transformed not only the software application market but also the print and media world. The browser-based Internet launched many new companies, several of which have achieved market capitalizations in the billions. Most interestingly, new company wealth (pure play Internet companies) far exceeds “transitioned wealth” (incumbent companies transitioning their model successfully to the new platform). TripAdvisor and Yelp rule the day, not Frommers and Zagat. Likewise Priceline and Expedia rule travel, not some travel company that existed pre-Internet. Google, Yahoo, Ebay, Facebook, and Twitter rule the Internet, not Microsoft.

  <p>The core concept of “search” is in transition. Search plays a completely different role on the desktop than it does on the smartphone. On the browser, nearly every activity starts with search. On the smartphone, apps replace search as a starting point.

<p>Exactly my thoughts. Browsers are search-centric, mobile devices are app-centric. The question is if the mobile appstores should incorporate more search like features.</p>
